**Initial Notes**

- It's difficult for people to reliably and consistently connect the actions they choose to take in the moment to their desires for longer term outcomes. The immediacy and stronger felt desire of short-term benefits often win out over more abstract long-term benefits, or it's difficult for the human mind to grasp the compounding benefit of small, consistent choices to long term goals.
- In regard to money specifically (spending, savings) it'd be helpful to be able easily, quickly, and compellingly connect the impact of a choice in the moment (e.g. whether to spend or how much to spend) to future financial goals (e.g. how much choice may impact, delay, or speed up reaching goals).
- It feels like determining this impact would be relatively simple to execute programmatically/mathematically and the challenge is more likely a UX problem â€“ how to compellingly connect and communicate a possible action to goal(s), and how to make this information available quickly and easily such that it can affect in the moment behavior.
