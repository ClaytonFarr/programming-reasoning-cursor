# Idea

**Initial Notes**

- It's difficult for people to reliably and consistently connect the actions they choose to take in the moment to their desires for longer term outcomes. The immediacy and stronger felt desire of short-term benefits often win out over more abstract long-term benefits, or it's difficult for the human mind to grasp the compounding benefit of small, consistent choices to long term goals.
- In regard to money specifically (spending, savings) it'd be helpful to be able easily, quickly, and compellingly connect the impact of a choice in the moment (e.g. whether to spend or how much to spend) to future financial goals (e.g. how much choice may impact, delay, or speed up reaching goals).
- It feels like determining this impact would be relatively simple to execute programmatically/mathematically and the challenge is more likely a UX problem â€“ how to compellingly connect and communicate a possible action to goal(s), and how to make this information available quickly and easily such that it can affect in the moment behavior.

**Clarifying Questions**

- Q: What specific financial goals are we considering? Are they user-defined or preset (e.g. retirement savings, buying a house, paying off debt, etc.)?
- A: I think in the long run I'd like to have these be user-defined, but they could be presets initially to determine if app is having intended effect and the first release a little bit smaller if that would help

- Q: What are the key factors that influence the impact of a financial decision on these goals? Interest rates, time horizon, risk tolerance, etc.?
- A: I think the bigger ones are likely time horizon, and possibly the effects of compounding interest, but I'd be open to suggestions for other factors that could impact this as well as we explore the application's design.

- Q: How do we plan to gather the necessary data to make these calculations and how will the application ensure it's providing accurate and up-to-date financial information and advice?? User input, integration with financial institutions, etc.?
- A: In the long term, this would probably come via a service that integrates the app with their banking data to gather historical and up-to-date spending and finances. In the short term it could be something simpler where perhaps they're measuring the choice of a saving or spending action via direct input against their long-term goals. The longer-term purpose is to have it be a real world accurate view of their current financial state, their current financial decision, and how that impacts their stated financial goals based on with material data as possible. That said, we should also keep our focus on our primary goals of connecting the dots between - a user's' expressed long-term financial goals, a user's total available funds and how these have been allocated across goals (past, present, and future), and a user's pending current financial decision/action. It may be that we don't need the same fidelity of financial information from their banking data if we can track and represent these other values meaningfully (e.g. tracking aggregate amounts).

- Q: What are the key elements of the user experience that would make this tool compelling and easy to use? Visualization, real-time feedback, personalization, etc.?
- A: I'm not certain yet. I'm interested for us to explore possibly simple and/or innovative ways to help bridge this gap between a current action and its future effect in the most compelling and simple way. Definitely open to all relevant ideas.

- Q: How do we plan to present this information to the user? Will it be in the form of a notification, a dashboard, etc.?
- A: I'm definitely open to different ideas here. The overriding goals would be to have this be innocuous and simple enough to be easily present when the user is debating a present action. Although this feedback could occur after an event (e.g. a purchase) it'd be best if it somehow is easy for the user to ask for, or somehow preemptively get feedback before taking the action (e.g. deciding to spend, not spend, or how much to spend).

- Q: How do we plan to motivate users to make better financial decisions based on the information provided by the application?
- A: I'm not certain yet and eager to explore and evaluate different options together.

- Q: How will we ensure the privacy and security of the user's financial information?
- A: Presumably, this would be largely afforded via the security of their own devices and the security of any services we use to integrate and transfer financial data. We would be responsible to safely store any information for them. There may also be the opportunity to possibly approach this differently than a traditional budgeting app - where rather than capturing and storing all individual transactions, we are tracking and storing some meaningful aggregates of this data (e.g. total funds, how funds are allocated, etc.).

- Q: How will the application handle different currencies and exchange rates if it's going to be used internationally?
- A: Initially will just focus on dollars and using this with US customers.

- Q: How will the application handle changes in financial goals or user's financial situation over time?
- A: That's interesting. I think this is one area where we might be able to innovate. The idea perhaps of having a feedback loop when someone chooses to change their current behavior and how this changes their long-term goals and able to ratify the effect of that present choice. I want to look at opportunities for how we can help someone balance short-term desires and long-term desires, by informing their decisions across both of these most effectively.

- Q: What kind of support or resources will be available to users if they have questions or need help using the application?
- A: The app should have a simple and elegant onboarding that leverages smart/common defaults as much as possible to help new users get started as quickly and successfully as possible. Help resources initially can be presumed to be self-serve documentation and help/tutorial videos.

- Q: How will the application handle financial emergencies or unexpected expenses that could significantly impact a user's financial goals?
- A: This is a great question. These represent an example of the immediate/present financial decisions and actions one would be weighing against longer-term goals. This application should help a user understand the balance and impact of that present need versus their future desires.

# Problem to Solve

Many individuals struggle to connect their immediate financial decisions with their long-term financial goals. This disconnect often leads to short-term desires winning over long-term benefits. The challenge lies in creating a tool that can quickly and compellingly illustrate the impact of immediate financial choices on future financial goals. This is especially true for young-adult audiences who don't have much experience with long-term effect (negative or positive) of their actions.

# Audience & Contexts

The primary audience for this application are individuals who have long-term financial goals but struggle to make immediate financial decisions that align with these goals. The application will be most useful in everyday contexts where individuals are making decisions about spending and saving.
