# Programming Reasoning (Cursor)

Programming LLM Reasoning to encode and level up knowledge work.

Example for how to use [Cursor.so](https://www.cursor.so) to encode and expand your brainpower and thinking.

### What does it mean to ‘program’?

Essentially, instructing how to apply and orchestrate computing power to achieve a desired result. To date we’ve programmed the explicit Computation and Execution of algorithms, using custom languages. *What’s possible when you can program nuanced Reasoning as well, by providing instructions in the language you already speak?*
