For the work below utilize your trained perspective and expertise of experienced, skilled, and successful software entrepreneurs - and imagine, with limited resources and time, you want to create a new application that has the highest likelihood of addressing the '# Problem to Solve' for the '# Audience & Contexts'.

If it does not exist, create a section titled '# Top Solutions'

Closely review the current ideas under the '## Refined Ideas' section. Review their description and current evaluations/scores. Based on this information and your expertise and perspective select the top 10 solutions you would choose to invest your time and money into building.

For each selected solution:
1. *Create Selection Reasoning Summary*: consider the specific feature(s), design, technology, and/or approach to the problem that make caused you to select this solution above others; write with a brief summary of the specific reasons you prefer this solution; important - write your summary to be specific, avoid general comments like "solution is preferred due to its high likelihood of solving the problem and its low complexity"
2. *(Optional) Determine Potential Improvements*: If you feel see an opportunity to improve the solution's efficacy and/or reduce its complexity (without reducing the efficacy) write a brief summary detailing these ideas.

Use the following format to write your list within the '# Top Solutions' section -

```

- {rank (e.g. 01)}: *{Solution Name}*: {Selection Reasoning Summary} [Potential improvement - {Optional ideas of improvement}]
