# Evaluate 

Within the section '## Initial Ideas' there are a range of possible solutions for our '# Problem to Solve' for our '# Audience & Contexts'.

These solutions are possible ideas conceived from various ideation perspectives (e.g. JTBD, SCAMPER, BLANK-CHECK). Each solution has received a preliminary score based on 1: its likelihood to effectively solve the problem (high|medium|low) and 2: the level of complexity/scope required to create a meaningful first version (high|medium|low).

If it does not exist, create a section within "# Solution Ideas" titled '## Refined Ideas'.

Go through each ideation technique section listed within '## Initial Ideas' (e.g. HYPOTHETICAL, SCAMPER, etc). For each solution under each ideation technique:

1. *Take inspiration & consider*: Review all possible solutions and consider what ideas or insights from any of these might be applicable to improving this solution's efficacy and/or reduction of complexity. Determine if it is possible to increase the solution's efficacy without increasing complexity - or reduce its complexity without reducing its efficacy. If this seems possible, continue with steps below - if this seems highly unlikely, write `- *{Solution Name}*: Did not refine {reasons you not possible to increase efficacy or reduce complexity}` and move on to next possible solution.
2. *Determine how to increase solution's efficacy*: Consider the specific ways we might increase this solution's efficacy and likelihood of solving our problem to be as high as possible. Write a brief summary that describes these changes/improvements to original solution (this will be referred to as `{Efficacy Updates Summary}` below.)
3. *Determine how to reduce solution's complexity*: Consider the specific ways we might reduce this solution's technical complexity (specifically ways to reduce feature complexity and/or backend development; frontend complexity should be avoided but is less of a concern) and scope to build a meaningful first version to be as low as possible. Write a brief summary that describes these changes/improvements to original solution (this will be referred to as `{Complexity Updates Summary}` below.)
4. *Create Refined Solution Summary*: write an updated summary of the solution that describes the refined solution's details (features, design, technology) and how these specifically help solve the problem for the audience; the summary should encapsulate the original concept plus any revisions to its efficacy and/or complexity; the summary should be specific enough to clearly identify how it is unique from other solutions; be as detailed as necessary while still being as brief as possible (try to stay under 350 characters in length)
5. *Create Evaluation Summary*: evaluate the solution's likelihood to solve the problem effectively (including reasons why) and the likely technical complexity/scope required to to build and distribute a meaningful first version (including reasons why); rate the evaluated likelihood and complexity/scope as 'high', 'med', or 'low' (see details below for Technical Complexity/Scope Ratings); determine a solution score using the Scoring Rubric below and write a brief summary of your evaluation using the format: `Score: {score} - {high|medium|low} likelihood of solving problem ({reason(s)}), {high|medium|low} complexity ({reason(s)})`

TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY/SCOPE RATINGS:

- low = simple/web technologies | limited feature set | can be built by 1-2 engineers in < 1 month
- medium = moderate technology | moderate features set | could be built by 2-3 engineers in < 3 months
- high = advanced technology | expansive feature set | requires 5+ engineers to deliver < 6 months

SCORING RUBRIC:

| Likelihood | Complexity/Scope | Score |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| High       | High             | 5     |
| High       | Medium           | 8     |
| High       | Low              | 10    |
| Med        | High             | 4     |
| Med        | Medium           | 7     |
| Med        | Low              | 8     |
| Low        | High             | 1     |
| Low        | Medium           | 3     |
| Low        | Low              | 6     |

Use the following format to write the refined solutions within the '## Refined Ideas' section -

```

*{TECHNIQUE-LABEL (e.g. HYPOTHETICAL)}*
- *{Solution Name}*: {Refined Solution Summary}. (Improved efficacy by {Efficacy Updates Summary}; reduced complexity by {Complexity Updates Summary}. [{Evaluation Summary}])
- ...
```
